				<h2>About</h2>
			</div>

			<p>I can proudly say I'm doing what I want to do with my life, and don't think for a minute I don't realize how lucky I am.  It took me a long time to get to this point but I couldn't be more thankful.</p>

			<p>I work for IT-oLogy, a technology education nonprofit based in Columbia, SC, and have done so for more nearly three years.  The organization itself is focused on highlighting the demand for technology skills in the workplace and overall economy, and the resulting need for more people with these skills.  Because I am old enough to have seen the workplace transition from a more manual environment with less technology to one nearly completely enabled by it, I am a huge believer more people need basic tech skills.  To have an opportunity to educate people and convey a message I wish I had heard when I was young is simply fantastic.</p>

			<p>For more than 10 years I've been focusing on open source technology and the community that is so vital to its success.  I regularly organize open technology conferences throughout the southeast and have created three that are somewhat successful.  The most enjoyable aspect of the events is providing an opportunity for people to learn and meet other like-minded people. They also provide an excellent opportunity to stay current and meet others in the field.</p>

			<p>I've been in the technology field in one form or another for more than 15 years.  Hands down it was the best decision of my life, but one that wasn't necessarily a "natural progression" shall we say.  I was raised in southern West Virginia in a coal mining family, and computers were way too expensive for us to have one in the house.  As a result my exposure to technology was limited to Atari and typewriters the entire time I was home.  It wasn't until college that I had a chance to experience a personal computer and really understand the possibilities computing and technology in general make possible.  It really opened up a new world and enabled me to expand my horizons beyond then-present circumstances.  Needless to say I haven't looked back.</p>

				<h2>Values</h2>
			</div>

			<p>"Beware the person with no core values" the saying goes and I happen to believe it.  At the core of every human being is a set of values that transcends the physical and what we see on a daily basis. Here are a few of mine:</p>

			<p>Hard work is extremely honorable 
			I was raised in a family in which hard work was a virtue, and that has stuck with me.  I can honestly say it has shaped me more than almost anything else.  When you're raised watching people occupy themselves with honest hard work it does something to you, and I'm convinced it never leaves.  I'm very happy it doesn't.  It levels the playing field and makes things possible that never otherwise would have been.</p>

			<p>We have an obligation to help others
			I was luckily raised by a mother and father that were incredibly caring and giving, and still are to this day. I regularly saw them do things that will never be broadcast to a nationwide audience, and will never be known to anyone but me and my sisters really, but they were self-sacrificing.  And even more important, they were done voluntarily, unprompted by anyone but their own conscience and heart for others.  To this day I volunteer a lot, and sit on nonprofit boards, and generally do everything I can to help people, and I owe a lot of that to my parents. I feel people have an obligation to help others and give back in their own way, whatever that looks like.  </p>
